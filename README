STARTING THE BOT
----------------

    Unix: $ python JibotLaunch.py
	Windows: C:\> python JibotLaunch.py

    A default config file is included as jibot.conf

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

JibotLaunch.py supports the following options:
    -v, --verbose   Gives you more output to STDOUT, use twice for more effect
    -c, --config    Lets you specify the config file to load

	
ADDING COMMANDS
---------------

Commands are done via handlers now, to add a new set of commands extend the
MessageHandler class in JibotInterface, in handle you will want to run a check
for the command text against m.cmd, the text after the command character
(usually '?) is parsed by the message class itself if there is any, e.g.:

HelloWorldHandler(MessageHandler):
    def __init__(self,root,name='HelloWorldHandler'):
        MessageHandler.__init__(self,root=root,name=name)
        self._handles=("hello",) #note: this is a tuple
    
    def handle(self,m):
        MessageHandler.handle(self,m)
        if "hello" == m.cmd:
            self._root.say("Hello")
            return True


Then in JibotLaunch you will want to add this as a handler under the CmdHandler
object, eg.:
    
    helloHandler = HelloWorldHandler(root=jibot)
    cmdHandler.add_handler(helloHandler)


The documentation on most of the additions is pretty poor, so bear with us.

CHANGES
-------
2004-05-19 - 0.6.1.2
    - Fixed the behavior in which a person who has no def is heralded as 
      unknown even if we've already seen them.
    - Fixed an issue with people being re-heralded after a netsplit by
      setting the last_herald for them more often (on quit, for instance)
      Also checks if the nick is in cur_nicks before heralding, in case it
      never saw the person quit (first out in netsplit, first in scenario)
      If netsplit lasts for more than 10 minutes, all bets are off, it will
      herald the first two 'new' nicks it sees.
    - Gave ?quit the option of including a custom message, 
      e.g. '?quit QUick update...'
    - Fixed a typo where favorites was spelled favorties
    - Fixed another typo that was sending cmd_favorites many arguments
    - Added a default behavior for a ?karma with no argument
    - Replaced some of the defDB functionality with a re.split() to split on
      'and' and '&' as well as stripping them from the front of an entry 
      should they show up there. This means you can ?def and ?forget multiple
      items at once.
    - Added useful information to ?forget when multiple phrases are being
      removed.
    - Fixed another issue with favorites with things being treated as boolean
      instead of int
    - Uses the identification checking to securely identify the owners as well
      as The Queen
    - Allows the ?forgetnick, ?heraldme, and queen commands in private message
      if identification checking is on and the user is identified
    - Added jeanniecool as a default owner
    - Added technorati as a default channel
    - Will now only recognize nicks it has seen before for favoring, to
      prevent favoring of odd things and phrases, also forces everthing into
      lowercase
    - Removed the delay from the say and action commands, freenode staff says
      that throttling won't be a problem
    - Added a default ?blog action that gives the location of the blog
    - Nick didn't pass any useful parameters, so it is ignored in the parse()
      method for JibotMessage.
    - The Technorati API is now updated to handle the latest version should
      the date formate be changed, and has more error handling regardless.
    
2004-04-25 - 0.6.1.1
    - Added the ability to check for identification, the config file setting
      is 'check_identification'(boolean), and is on by default, currently
      nothing is checking against this, however.
    - Added the ability to identify with NickServ using a password stored in
      a plaintext file, 'identifykey.txt' by default, and is off by default
      because you will need to register the nick before it can be used.
      The config options for this functionality are 'identify'(boolean) and
      'identify_key_file'(filename)
    - Fixed a bug with ?learn_first, it was using some early code and wasn't
      converting to a string.
    - Added some type checks to the defDB
    - Made ?help respond in PM, ?help by itself will PM you with the message
      while ?help <nick> will PM that nick
      
2004-04-20 - 0.6
    - Now requires Python 2.3 and SQLite (for SQLite db integration)
    - Massive refactor, jibot.py has been replaced by JibotConfig,
      JibotDatabase, JibotInterface, JibotLaunch, and JibotOptions
    - Added command-line option parsing
    - Added configuration file parsing
    - Included test and debug startup scripts and configurations
    - Included a rudimentary jibot pickle to sqlite database converter
    - Added commands savedefs, savenicks, savekarmas, savefavors, join,
      part, silence, quiet, unquiet
    - Added support for SQLite databases, as well as a database abstraction
      layer for future database integrations
    - Combined favorites and disfavorites into one database
    - Removed the 'lastherald' property of a masternick entry, the masternick
      database now only holds the aka's of each nick
    - Added parsing of "and" and "&" in defs, separating the definitions
    - Added incoming string sanitization to remove unprintable characters
    - Moved to the new Amazon XMLRPC url
    - The karmadump.rpy and braindump.rpy aren't really being used at all
      right now, that should change later on, but for now that stuff is on hold

jibot needs Python 2.3

- for SQLite support you will need to get SQLite, info available at
  pysqlite.sourceforge.net

If you are upgrading from a pre-SQLite version and would like to convert the
databases, the "dbconverter.py" script should help you, but you will need to modify it.

You will need Technorati, Amazon and Google application keys to make use
of those features

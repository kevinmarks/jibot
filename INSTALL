jibot needs Python 2.3

- for SQLite support you will need to get SQLite, info available at
  pysqlite.sourceforge.net

If you are upgrading from a pre-SQLite version and would like to convert the
databases, the "dbconverter.py" script should help you, but you will need to modify it.

From http://diveintomark.org/projects/ download the following
libraries:

	- PyTechnorati
	- PyAmazon
	- PyGoogle
	- RSS Parser

You will need Technorati, Amazon and Google application keys.
